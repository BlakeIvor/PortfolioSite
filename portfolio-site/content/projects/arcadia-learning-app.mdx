## Project Overview

An innovative educational AR mobile learning app designed to help children better comprehend assigned reading material through interactive conversations with an AI companion. Arcadia transforms traditional reading comprehension into an engaging, interactive adventure where children can literally bring their books to life through augmented reality.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Interactive Companion**: Utilizes OpenAI API to create meaningful conversations about reading material, adapting to each child's learning pace and style
- **3D Augmented Reality Interactions**: Built with Unreal Engine to create immersive AR experiences that make characters and concepts jump off the page
- **Intelligent Backend System**: FastAPI-powered content management system that tracks progress and personalizes learning paths
- **Adaptive Learning Technology**: Chat history and AI learning systems continuously improve the user experience over time
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Seamless experience across iOS and Android devices

## Technical Challenges

- **AR Integration**: Implementing advanced computer vision to recognize text and images for seamless AR overlays
- **Real-Time AI Processing**: Optimizing OpenAI API calls for responsive, contextual conversations
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Ensuring consistent AR performance across different mobile hardware configurations
- **Educational Psychology**: Balancing engaging technology with proven educational methodologies
- **Performance Optimization**: Managing battery life and processing power for extended learning sessions
- **Content Management**: Creating scalable systems for diverse reading materials and age groups

This project represents the future of educational technology, where learning becomes an adventure rather than a chore. Early testing has shown promising results with children demonstrating improved retention and enthusiasm for reading.
