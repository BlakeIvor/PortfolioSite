- **Encumbrance Tracking**: Automatic weight calculations to track carrying capacity and movement restrictions

## Technical Challenges

- **Database Design**: Creating efficient relational schemas to handle complex item relationships and character data
- **Docker Containerization**: Implementing containerized deployment for consistent environments across development and production
- **User Experience Optimization**: Designing intuitive interfaces that mirror familiar RPG inventory concepts while maintaining web usability
- **Performance Scaling**: Optimizing database queries for handling large inventories and multiple concurrent users
- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring consistent data validation and maintaining referential integrity across character equipment
- **Responsive Design**: Creating interfaces that work seamlessly across devices for use during gaming sessions

The application prioritizes ease of use with drag-and-drop item organization, quick-add buttons for common items, and visual categorization. This project demonstrates full-stack web development skills while solving a real problem for the tabletop gaming community, showcasing the ability to identify user needs and create practical, user-centered solutions.
