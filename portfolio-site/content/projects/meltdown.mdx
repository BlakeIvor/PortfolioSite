## Project Overview

An atmospheric side scroller mining game created in just 48 hours during a game jam. Players must dig, dodge, and survive as they descend into the treacherous depths of an underground world. The game combines strategic resource gathering with fast-paced action and atmospheric design.

## Key Features

- **Procedurally Generated Levels**: Each playthrough offers a unique underground experience with dynamically created cave systems
- **Mining & Resource Collection**: Strategic resource gathering mechanics that balance risk and reward
- **Dynamic Hazards**: Navigate through collapsing tunnels, toxic gases, and unstable terrain
- **Power-ups & Upgrades**: Enhance your mining equipment and abilities as you progress deeper
- **Atmospheric Design**: Immersive audio and visual design that captures the tension of underground exploration

## Technical Challenges

- **Rapid Development**: Creating a fully functional game within a 48-hour time constraint
- **Procedural Generation**: Implementing efficient algorithms for seamless, real-time level creation
- **Physics Optimization**: Developing a smooth mining interaction system with realistic debris and particle effects
- **Performance Management**: Maintaining consistent frame rates while generating complex underground environments
- **Audio Integration**: Creating atmospheric soundscapes that enhance the underground mining experience

The game successfully balances arcade-style action with strategic depth, creating an engaging experience that keeps players coming back to beat their previous depth records. This project showcases rapid prototyping skills and efficient development under extreme time constraints.
